## Symbolic Execution
Symbolic execution was proposed by [JK] three decades before, ...

## Current Development
### Traditional symbolic execution
### Concolic execution
### Compared with dynamic analysis
### Compared with testing techniques


## Tools

Reduce path by removing infeasible paths
Guided/Driven path exploration (Heuristic techniques)
### Constraint solving
Optimize constriant solver
Incremental solving
